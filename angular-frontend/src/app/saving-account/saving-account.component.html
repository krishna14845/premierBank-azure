        Saving accounts are a type of deposit account kept by banks that pay interest. They let a person keep some of their money in the bank for immediate use. They also earn money through interest. Having a savings account in a bank allows a person to have
        money available for an emergency. Savings accounts may be opened at most banks, credit unions and trust companies.
